n
Reflexive: Yes, all elements are present.
Symmetric: No,because (a,b) is found whereas (b,a) is not found.
Antisymmetric: Yes, because (a,b) is found whereas (b,a) is not found and other values provide this rule.
Transitive: Yes, all elements providing this rule.
n
Reflexive: No,because (e,e) is not found.
Symmetric: Yes, because (d,d) is found where (d,d) is found and other values provide this rule.
Antisymmetric: No, because (a,b) is found whereas (b,a) is found.
Transitive: Yes, all elements providing this rule.
n
Reflexive: Yes, all elements are present.
Symmetric: Yes, because (e,e) is found where (e,e) is found and other values provide this rule.
Antisymmetric: Yes, because (e,e) is found whereas (e,e) is not found and other values provide this rule.
Transitive: Yes, all elements providing this rule.
n
Reflexive: No,because (2,2) is not found.
Symmetric: Yes, because (2,1) is found where (1,2) is found and other values provide this rule.
Antisymmetric: No, because (1,2) is found whereas (2,1) is found.
Transitive: No,because (2,2) is not found where (2,1) and (1,2) are found.
n
Reflexive: No,because (3,3) is not found.
Symmetric: No,because (3,4) is found whereas (4,3) is not found.
